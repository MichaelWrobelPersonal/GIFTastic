# Description:

A dynamic site that utilizes AJAX and the GIPHY API to display GIFs of various topics.

# Details

The site utilizes the GIPHI API to pull up ten sample images based on some default topics and supports adding additional topics.   Pictures are displayed as still images and upon clicking them theay are animated.  This is accomplished by switching between two differant GIF images one which is a still and the other which has an animation in it.

Note: This site filters its images to display those only rated 'g' for general audiences.
