# GIFTastic

# Description:

A dynamic site that utilizes AJAX and the GIPHY API to display GIFs of various topics.

# Deployed site
[GifTastic](https://michaelwrobelpersonal.github.io/GIFTastic/)

# Technology Details

The site utilizes the GIPHI API to pull up ten sample images based on some default topics and supports adding additional topics.   Pictures are displayed as still images and upon clicking them theay are animated.  This is accomplished by switching between two differant GIF images one which is a still and the other which has an animation in it.

The underlying tchnology to use GIPHI are Ajax calls using JQuery Ajax calls 

Note: This site filters its images to display those only rated 'g' for general audiences.

# About the Theme

This project is more about the magic of using a graphical technology like GIPHY than anything in particular.  The choice of starting topics reflects some of my interests.  Others are easilly added by a visitor to the site.
