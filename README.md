# GIFTastic

# Description:

A dynamic site that utilizes AJAX and the GIPHY API to display GIFs of various topics.

# Deployed site
[GifTastic](https://michaelwrobelpersonal.github.io/GIFTastic/)

# Technology Details

The site utilizes the GIPHI API to pull up ten sample images based on some default topics and supports adding additional topics.   Pictures are displayed as still images and upon clicking them they are animated.  This is accomplished by switching between two different GIF images one of which is a still image and the other which has an animation embedded in it.

The underlying technology to use GIPHI are AJAX calls using the JQuery AJAX API 

Note: This site filters its images to display those only rated 'G' for general audiences.

# About the Theme

This project is more about the magic of using a graphical technology like GIPHY than anything in particular.  The choice of starting topics reflects some of my interests.  Others are easily added by a visitor to the site.
